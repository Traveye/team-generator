# Team Generator

## Goals

The goal of this project is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. A secondary goal is to also write a unit test for every part of the code to ensure that it passes each test. It is considered done when: 

- When the application starts, a user is prompted to enter the team manager's name, employee ID, email address, and office number.

- Then, the user is presented with options to add other team members either as Engineers or Interns. They are also presented with the opition to complete and receive a completed HTML at this point. 

- Once all team members are added the user is able to complete the input and this will generate a HTML file which displays the individual team members added. 

- Additionally, once the completed HTML page is opened, the user will be able to click on the team member's email as well as the GitHub usernames of all Engineers. The email link will open the default email application and the GitHub user name will open the user's page in the browser.
