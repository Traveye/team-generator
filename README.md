# Team Generator

## Goals

The goal of this project is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. A secondary goal is to also write a unit test for every part of the code to ensure that it passes each test. It is considered done when: 

- When the application starts, a user is prompted to enter the team manager's name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
